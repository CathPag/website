# Announcing September's Linkerd Hero

We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Cameron Boulton.
Congrats, Cameron! 


## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of
the Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions,
sharing their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or
contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the
Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.


## Congrats, Cameron!

This month's hero is
[Cameron Boulton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronboulton/).
Cameron did a fantastic investigation
on the Datadog and Linkerd trace integrations. Thanks to his contribution,
community members can more easily configure Linkerd proxy trace exports to
external collectors using the improved jaeger injector plugin, regardless
of the collector and exporter protocol. Thank you, Cameron, for making
future Datadog and Linkerd users' lives easier! 


## Nominate next month's Linkerd Hero

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
community’s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an
awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier.

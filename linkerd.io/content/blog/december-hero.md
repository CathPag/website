# Announcing December's Linkerd Hero

We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: TJ Miller. Congrats, TJ!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code
or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, TJ Miller!

This month's hero is [TJ Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tj-miller-16b827b0/).
TJ spearheaded the PR for injecting the Linkerd proxy as a native sidecar
container, a pattern that Linkerd has been relying on for a while but that,
as of Kubernetes 1.29, is given first-class support. This gives Linkerd
users many advantages, and we thank TJ for thoroughly researching this
feature and implementing it impeccably. Working with him and bringing this
exciting improvement to full fruition was a pleasure!

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
communityâ€™s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an
awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier.

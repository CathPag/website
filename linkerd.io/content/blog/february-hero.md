We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Yu Cao. Congrats, Yu!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the Linkerd community.
Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing their successes (and failures!)
with the world at large, or contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental
in making the Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Yu Cao!

This month's hero is [Yu Cao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-cao-6218a46/).
Yu recently successfully submitted a PR adding support for
service internal traffic policy to Linkerd. Thanks to his contributions, Linkerd users
can now take advantage of service internal traffic policy to route traffic to endpoints
on the originating node to save costs and improve performance. Thank you, Yu,
for contributing code and helping make Linkerd even better for our community!

or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your Linkerd Hero? Submit
